PRIVACY POLICY</h3><p>   Please refer to our privacy policy    <a href='http://www.bitmoon.net/privacy'>www.bitmoon.net/privacy</a>    for information about how we collect, use, and share your   information.</p><h3>4. YOUR GENERAL OBLIGATIONS TO USE THE SERVICES</h3><p>   <strong>4.1 Conditions and Restrictions.</strong> We may, at any   time and in our sole discretion, refuse any exchange transaction or   exchange bid submitted via the Services, impose limits on the   exchange amount permitted via the Services or impose any other   conditions or restrictions upon your use of the Services, without   prior notice. For example, we may limit the number of open orders   that you can establish via the Services or we may restrict exchanges   from certain locations.</p><p>   <strong>4.2 Accuracy of Information.</strong> You must provide any   information required when creating a Bitmoon Account or when   prompted by any screen displayed within the Services. You represent   and warrant that all information you provide via the Services is   accurate and complete.</p><p>   <strong>4.3 Cancellations.</strong> You may only cancel an order   initiated via the Services if such cancellation occurs before we   execute the transaction.    <strong>   Once your order has been executed, you may not change, withdraw,   or cancel your authorization for us to complete such transaction.   </strong>    If any order has been partially filled, you may cancel the unfilled   remainder of that order at any time. We reserve the right to refuse   any cancellation request associated with a market order once you   have submitted such order.</p><p>   <strong>4.4 Insufficient Funds.</strong> If you have an insufficient   amount of Virtual Currency in your Hosted Wallet to complete an   order via the Services, we may cancel the entire order or may   fulfill a partial order using the amount of Virtual Currency   currently available in your Hosted Wallet, less any fees owed to   Bitmoon in connection with the execution of the exchange (as   described in Section 8 below).</p><p>   <strong>4.5 Taxes.</strong> It is your responsibility to determine   what, if any, taxes apply to the exchange transactions you complete   via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit   the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that we   are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your   trades or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any   taxes arising from any trades.</p><p>   <strong>4.6 Market Availability.</strong> Bitmoon may open or close   any market for a Virtual Currency on the Site at any time, in its   sole discretion. If a market for a particular Virtual Currency is   closed, any open orders that you may have for such Virtual Currency   will be credited back to your Bitmoon Account.</p><p>   <strong>4.7 Currency Availability.</strong> Bitmoon retains the   right, in its sole discretion, to include a Virtual Currency on the   Site, and may remove any Virtual Currency from the Site at any time   for any reason. Unless otherwise required by law or law enforcement,   Bitmoon will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the likely   removal of a Virtual Currency. If the market for a Virtual Currency   is closed on the Site, you will have 14 days to push the amounts   remaining in your Bitmoon Account associated with such Virtual   Currency to your External Virtual Currency Address. Bitmoon will not   be liable to you for any losses, liability or expenses related to   the removal of a Virtual Currency.</p><h3>5. Bitmoon ACCOUNT</h3><p>   <strong>5.1 Funding your Bitmoon Account.</strong> In order to   complete an exchange via the Services (as described in Section 6),   you must first load Virtual Currency to your Hosted Wallet. You may   be required to verify that you control the External Virtual Currency   Address that you use to load Virtual Currency to your Hosted Wallet.</p><p>   <strong>   5.2 Sending Virtual Currency to an External Virtual Currency   Address.   </strong>    Provided that the balance of Virtual Currency in your Bitmoon   Account is greater than any minimum balance requirements needed to   satisfy any of your open positions, you may send any amount of   Virtual Currency, up to the total amount of Virtual Currency in your   Bitmoon Account, in excess of such minimum balance requirements,   from your Hosted Wallet to an External Virtual Currency Address,   less any fees charged by Bitmoon for such transactions (as described   in the Fee Schedule (as defined in Section 8) at the time of your   request to push Virtual Currency to an External Virtual Currency   Address). You are solely responsible for the accuracy of the   External Virtual Currency Address that you provide, and Bitmoon   shall not be liable for sending Virtual Currency from your Hosted   Wallet to an incorrect External Virtual Currency Address if that   address matches the address you provided to us.</p><p>   <strong>5.3 Load/Push Authorization.</strong> When you request that   we send Virtual Currency to your External Virtual Currency Address   from your Bitmoon Account, you authorize Bitmoon to execute such   transaction using your Hosted Wallet via the Services.</p><h3>6. EXCHANGE ORDERS AND TRADES</h3><p>   <strong>6.1 Authorization.</strong> When you submit a new exchange   order via the Services, you authorize us to execute a transaction in   accordance with such order on a spot basis and charge you any   applicable fees (as described in Section 8 below).</p><p>   <strong>6.2 Independent relationship.</strong> You agree that: (a)   we are not acting as your broker, intermediary, agent, or advisor,   or in any fiduciary capacity, and (b) no communication or   information provided to you by us shall be considered or construed   as advice.</p><p>   <strong>6.3 Trade confirmation.</strong> Before a trade is placed, a   confirmation dialogue summarizes the details of the proposed   transaction, including the number of coins you are trying to buy or   sell, the price, the applicable fees, and the total cost of the   transaction. Once the Services execute your exchange transaction,   your account&rsquo;s order book will be updated with either the open   trade request, or a closed order that was fulfilled. You agree that   the failure of the Services to provide such confirmation shall not   prejudice or invalidate the terms of such trade.</p><p>   <strong>6.4 Market volatility.</strong> You agree that we are not   liable for any price fluctuations in Virtual Currency. In the event   of a market disruption or Force Majeure Event (as defined in Section   22.3), we may do one or more of the following: (a) suspend access to   the Services; or (b) prevent you from completing any actions via the   Services, including closing any open positions. We will not be   liable for any losses suffered by you resulting from such actions.   Following any such event, when exchange transactions resume, you   acknowledge that prevailing market rates may differ significantly   from the rates available prior to such event.</p><p>   <strong>6.5 Exchange Settlement.</strong> Subject to the terms and   conditions in these Terms, we will use commercially reasonable   efforts to settle exchanges on a spot basis within two days of the   date upon which users have agreed to execute an exchange via the   Services.</p><h3>7. RISK DISCLOSURE</h3><p>   There are risks associated with utilizing an Internet-based trading   system including, but not limited to, the failure of hardware,   software, and Internet connections. You agree that we shall not be   responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors,   distortions, or delays you may experience when trading via the   Services, however caused.</p><h3>8. FEES</h3><p>   <strong>8.1 Amount of Fees.</strong> You agree to pay Bitmoon the   fees for exchanges completed via our Services (&ldquo;<strong>   <em>Fees</em>   </strong>&rdquo;) as made available via the fee schedule at    <a href='http://www.bitmoon.net/fees'>www.bitmoon.net/fees</a>    (&ldquo;<strong>       <em>Fee Schedule </em>   </strong>&rdquo;), which we may change from time to time. Any   changes to the Fee Schedule will become effective as of the   expiration of such notice period. The revised Fee Schedule will   apply prospectively to any exchanges that take place following the   effective date of such revised Fee Schedule.</p><p>   <strong>8.2 Payment of Fees. </strong>You authorize us, or our   designated payment processor, to charge or deduct funds from your   Hosted Wallet for any applicable Fees owed in connection with   exchange transactions you complete via the Services.</p><h3>9. ELECTRONIC NOTICES</h3><p>   <strong>9.1 Consent to Electronic Delivery.</strong> You consent to   receive electronically all communications, agreements, documents,   receipts, notices, and disclosures (collectively, &ldquo;<strong>   <em>Communications</em>   </strong>&rdquo;) that Bitmoon provides in connection with your   Bitmoon Account, Hosted Wallet, and/or use of the Services. You   agree that Bitmoon may provide these Communications to you by   posting them via the Services, by emailing them to you at the email   address you provide, and/or by sending an SMS or text message to a   mobile phone number that you provide. Your carrier's normal,   messaging, data, and other rates and fees may apply to any mobile   Communications. You should maintain copies of electronic   Communications by printing a paper copy or saving an electronic   copy. You may also contact us at    <a href='mailto:support@bitmoon.net'>support@bitmoon.net</a> to   request additional electronic copies of Communications or, for a   fee, paper copies of Communications (as described below).</p><p>   <strong>9.2 Hardware and Software Requirements.</strong> In order to   access and retain electronic Communications, you will need a   computer with an Internet connection that has a current web browser   with cookies enabled and 128-bit encryption. You will also need to   have a valid email address on file with Bitmoon and have sufficient   storage space to save past Communications or an installed printer to   print them.</p><p>   <strong>9.3 Withdrawal of Consent.</strong> You may withdraw your   consent to receive electronic Communications by sending a withdrawal   notice to    <a href='mailto:support@bitmoon.net'>support@bitmoon.net</a>. If you   decline or withdraw consent to receive electronic Communications,   Bitmoon may suspend or terminate your use of the Services.</p><p>   <strong>9.4 Requesting Paper Copies.</strong> If, after you consent   to receive Communications electronically, you would like a paper   copy of a Communication we previously sent you, you may request a   copy within 30 days after the date we provided the Communication to   you by contacting us as at    <a href='mailto:support@bitmoon.net'>support@bitmoon.net</a>. In   order for us to send paper copies to you, you must have a current   street address on file with Bitmoon. Please note that our Services   operate exclusively online and it is very burdensome for us to   produce paper copies of Communications. Therefore, if you request   paper copies, you agree that we may charge you a processing fee, in   the amount described in the Fee Schedule at    <a href='http://www.bitmoon.net/fees'>www.bitmoon.net/fees</a> for   each page of Communication requested.</p><p>   <strong>9.5 Updating Contact Information.</strong> It is your   responsibility to keep your email address and/or mobile phone number   on file with Bitmoon up to date so that Bitmoon can communicate with   you electronically. If we send you an electronic Communication but   you do not receive it because your email address or mobile phone   number on file is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service   provider, or you are otherwise unable to receive electronic   Communications, we will be deemed to have provided the Communication   to you. Please note that if you use a spam filter that blocks or   re-routes emails from senders not listed in your email address book,   you must add Bitmoon to your email address book so that you will be   able to receive the Communications we send to you. You can update   your email address, mobile phone number, or street address at any   time by logging into your Bitmoon Account or by sending such   information to    <a href='mailto:support@bitmoon.net'>support@bitmoon.net</a> and    <a href='mailto:mailer@bitmoon.net'>mailer@bitmoon.net</a> . If your   email address or mobile phone number becomes invalid such that   electronic Communications sent to you by Bitmoon are returned, we   may deem your account to be inactive, and you may not be able to   complete any transaction via our Services until we receive a valid,   working email address or mobile phone number from you.</p><h3>10. UNCLAIMED PROPERTY</h3><p>   If for any reason Bitmoon is holding Virtual Currency in your Hosted   Wallet on your behalf, and we are unable to return your Virtual   Currency to your designated External Virtual Currency Address after   a period of inactivity, then we may report and remit such Virtual   Currency in accordance with applicable state unclaimed property   laws.</p><h3>11. ACCEPTABLE USE</h3><p>   When accessing or using the Services, you agree that you will not   violate any law, contract, intellectual property or other   third-party right, or commit a tort, and that you are solely   responsible for your conduct while using our Services. Without   limiting the generality of the foregoing, you agree that you will   not:</p><ul>   <li>      Use our Services in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt,      negatively affect, or inhibit other users from fully enjoying our      Services, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the      functioning of our Services in any manner;   </li>   <li>      Use our Services to pay for, support, or otherwise engage in any      illegal gambling activities; fraud; money-laundering; or terrorist      activities; or other illegal activities;   </li>   <li>      Use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or other automated means      or interface not provided by us to access our Services or to      extract data;   </li>   <li>      Use or attempt to use another user&rsquo;s account without      authorization;   </li>   <li>      Attempt to circumvent any content filtering techniques we employ,      or attempt to access any service or area of our Services that you      are not authorized to access;   </li>   <li>      Introduce to the Services any malware, virus, trojan worms, logic      bombs, or other harmful material;   </li>   <li>      Develop any third-party applications that interact with our      Services without our prior written consent, or unless otherwise      agreed;   </li>   <li>Provide false, inaccurate, or misleading information;</li>   <li>      Post content or communications that are, in our sole discretion,      libelous, defamatory, profane, obscene, pornographic, sexually      explicit, indecent, lewd, vulgar, suggestive, harassing, hateful,      threatening, offensive, discriminatory, bigoted, abusive,      inflammatory, fraudulent, deceptive or otherwise objectionable;   </li>   <li>      Post content containing unsolicited promotions, political      campaigning, or commercial messages (SPAM) or any chain messages      or user content designed to deceive or trick the user of the      Service;   </li>   <li>      Post content containing private information of any third-party      including, but not limited to, addresses, phone numbers, email      addresses, Social Security numbers and credit card numbers; and   </li>   <li>      Encourage or induce any third party to engage in any of the      activities prohibited under this Section.   </li></ul><h3>12. FEEDBACK</h3><p>   We will own exclusive rights, including all intellectual property   rights, to any feedback, suggestions, ideas, or other information or   materials regarding Bitmoon or our Services that you provide,   whether by email, posting through our Services, or otherwise   (&ldquo;<strong>   <em>Feedback</em>   </strong>&rdquo;). Any Feedback you submit is non-confidential and   shall become the sole property of Bitmoon. We will be entitled to   the unrestricted use and dissemination of such Feedback for any   purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or   compensation to you. You waive any rights you may have to the   Feedback (including any copyrights or moral rights). Do not send us   Feedback if you expect to be paid or want to continue to own or   claim rights in them; your idea might be great, but we may have   already had the same or a similar idea and we do not want disputes.   We also have the right to disclose your identity to any third party   who is claiming that any content posted constitutes a violation of   their intellectual property rights, or of their right to privacy. We   have the right to remove any posting you make on our site if, in our   opinion, your post does not comply with the requirements set out in   this Section 12 or in Section 11 (Acceptable Use) Further, you agree   not to submit any Feedback that is defamatory, illegal, offensive,   or otherwise violates any right of any third party, or breaches any   agreement between you and any third party.</p><p>   A user may report to Bitmoon any Feedback that he or she believes   violates these Terms, and Bitmoon may remove the Feedback from the   Site, suspend or terminate the account of the user who submitted the   Feedback, and/or take any additional action to enforce these Terms   against such user.</p><p>   Also, in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (<strong      >   <em>DMCA</em>   </strong>) and other applicable law, Bitmoon has adopted a policy of   terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion,   account holders who are deemed to be repeat infringers. We also may,   at our discretion, limit access to the Services and terminate the   accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights   of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.&nbsp;</p><p>   Please see 17 U.S.C. &sect; 512(c)(3) for the requirements of a   proper notification.
